## Multi-Model Learning: Image Captioning with Conventional and CLIP + GPT-2 Models

**Repository Overview:**

This repository hosts the assets for our multi-model learning project focused on image captioning. We utilize both conventional vision-language models and an innovative combination of CLIP and GPT-2 to generate contextually relevant text descriptions from input images.

**Models Explored:**
1. **Conventional Vision-Language Model (VLM)**: This employs VGG16, a convolutional neural network, for image feature extraction, while an LSTM network crafts word sequences that encapsulate the essence of the images.
2. **CLIPCap Model**: Our advanced model that synergizes the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model with GPT-2 to produce captions. The inherent ability of CLIP to understand the association between text and images makes it exemplary for captioning tasks. Integrating GPT-2 ensures the generated captions are coherent and apt for the image context.

### Detailed Project Summary:

Our multi-model learning venture is centered around designing and evaluating deep learning models that can articulate accurate descriptions for provided images. We have delved into conventional architectures and an avant-garde model that melds CLIP with GPT-2.

**Conventional VLMs** are typically primed on datasets consisting of text-image pairs. They are versatile, capable of performing an array of tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, and visual dialogue. For our foundational model, we chose a tandem of the VGG16 CNN and LSTM networks: the former extracts features from images and the latter converts these features into descriptive word sequences.

Our mainstay, the **CLIPCap** model, combines the strengths of the CLIP model and GPT-2. CLIP, through its pretraining phase, is adept at linking text with corresponding images, positioning it as a strong contender for image captioning chores. By training CLIPCap on a dataset that pairs text with images and another that boasts human-generated captions, the model is exposed to the intricate dynamics of text-image relationships and human descriptive tendencies.

Training Insights:
- Our foundational model, VGG16+LSTMs, is shaped by the Flickr8k dataset, ensuring it understands the nexus between image content and natural language portrayals.
- The advanced CLIPCap model is fine-tuned with the pre-trained CLIP on the same Flickr8k dataset, aligning it perfectly with our image captioning objectives.
